# SudoGraff

Hacking some drawing code from the awesome RayW Site. 
Instead of just a drawing on a blank slate module,
we are going to have people draw on live video and then take a snapshot

This will be used for good natured mischeviousness (leaving virtual
graffiti, doing live drawing videos, and even teaching and learning)
to leave in various "locations"

Would also like to use finger sticker drawing  / stickers for learning
how to use technical equipment like the shop, or enabling people to leave instructions. Let's see how it goes.
